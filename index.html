            <p class="htc" >HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML is the backbone of a website, providing the structure and content that the web browser renders to the user.
              1. <u> Structuring content :</u> HTML provides a way to organize and structure content on the web, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables etc. <br>
              2.<u> Defining semantics :</u> HTML elements provide meaning to the content, making it easier for search engines and screen readers to understand the content. <br>
              3. <u> Creating web pages :</u> HTML is used to create web pages, including text, images, videos, and other multimedia content.

            <p class="csc">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It enables web developers to separate content from design, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the layout and appearance of web pages.
  When it comes to paragraphs, CSS plays a crucial role in enhancing readability and aesthetics. By applying CSS, you can modify various properties such as font size, color, line height, and spacing.</p>

            <p class="jsc">JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It enables developers to implement complex features such as animated graphics, form validations, and real-time updates without requiring a page reload.
  In the context of web development, JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance user experience. For instance, when a user clicks a button, JavaScript can be employed to display a hidden section of content or validate user input in a form. This interactivity is crucial for modern web applications, making them more engaging and user-friendly.

            <p class="jac">Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s. It is designed to be platform-independent, allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This feature, known as "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), makes Java a popular choice for building cross-platform applications.
  Java is widely used in various domains, including web development, mobile applications (especially Android), enterprise software, and large-scale systems. Its robust security features, extensive libraries, and strong community support contribute to its versatility. For instance, Java is the backbone of many enterprise-level applications, where reliability and scalability are crucial. Additionally, Java's syntax is similar to C++, making it easier for programmers familiar with those languages to adapt.

          <li class="sq">MySQL</li> 
            <p class="myc">MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that utilizes Structured Query Language (SQL) for accessing and managing data. It is widely recognized for its reliability, performance, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for web applications, data warehousing, and e-commerce platforms. MySQL allows users to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently, supporting various data types and complex queries.
  One of the key advantages of MySQL is its ability to handle large volumes of data while maintaining high performance. It is often used in conjunction with web development technologies such as PHP and JavaScript, enabling developers to build dynamic and interactive websites. Additionally, MySQL supports various storage engines, allowing for flexibility in data management and optimization based on specific application needs. Overall, MySQL serves as a robust foundation for data-driven applications, ensuring data integrity and security.

            <p class="jdc">Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a Java-based API that enables Java applications to interact with a variety of databases. It provides a standard interface for connecting to relational databases, executing SQL queries, and retrieving results. JDBC is essential for developers who need to perform database operations such as inserting, updating, or deleting records.
  The primary components of JDBC include the DriverManager, which manages the database drivers, and the Connection interface, which establishes a connection to the database. By using JDBC, developers can write database-independent code, allowing for greater flexibility and portability across different database systems.

            <p class="spc">
                Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework that simplifies the process of building and deploying Spring applications. It is designed to streamline the development process by providing a set of conventions and defaults, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than boilerplate code. With its embedded server capabilities, Spring Boot enables developers to run applications without the need for external server configurations, making it ideal for microservices architecture.
  One of the key features of Spring Boot is its auto-configuration, which automatically configures the application based on the dependencies present in the project. This significantly reduces the time and effort required to set up a Spring application. Additionally, Spring Boot offers a wide range of production-ready features, such as health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration, which enhance the application's robustness and maintainability.

                I successfully completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) in 2024 with a first-class, securing 77% without any arrears. Over the course of these three enriching years, I not only enjoyed my college life but also laid a strong foundation in various programming languages, including Python, C++, and Java etc.

                My college placed great emphasis on academic excellence while also encouraging students to participate in co-curricular and extracurricular activities. This balanced environment helped me develop both technical skills and personal growth.

                These years were truly memorable — filled with valuable learning experiences, meaningful friendships, and opportunities that shaped me both professionally and personally.

            This project is designed with customer safety in mind by ensuring that only valid (non-expired) products are billed. If a product is expired, the system displays a warning ⚠️ to the billing employee and prevents it from being added to the bill. Additionally, if a product's stock is low, the system alerts the employee to update the stock. This helps minimize customer complaints and ensures better inventory management.
